# CincyHacks--Molly-and-Dara
Our submission for CincyHacks2021
Hi!
We made this site to make mental health resources and information readily available to the general public. Although it is not live yet, we hope to make it live and continue working on it. We will try to add a blog space where users can interact with each other, as well as a chat where they can contact someone individually. This site is designed to be extremely user friendly so anyone, no matter their age or technology abilities, can utilize it fully. We wanted to have it be both educational and useful for those it is educating about. It has both facts and helpful resources so everyone has something to gain from visiting it. We hope this will have a net positive impact on society as it educates about mental health and helps those struggling. Hope you like it!
