# CincyHacks--Molly-and-Dara
Our submission for CincyHacks2021
Hi!
We made this site to make mental health resources and information readily available to the general public. Although it is not live yet, we hope to make it live and continue working on it. We will try to add a blog space where users can interact with each other, as well as a chat where they can contact someone individually. This site is designed to be extremely user friendly so anyone, no matter their age or technology abilities, can utilize it fully. We hope you like it!
